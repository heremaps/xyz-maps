 * The Style object defines how certain features should be rendered.
 * A style object must always contain the attributes "zIndex" and "type" as well as the mandatory attributes of the corresponding "type":
 * - Circle: "radius" must be included and either "fill" or "stroke" should be included.
 * - Rect: "width" must be included and "height" will be set with the same value as "width" if only "width" is present. Either "fill" or "stroke" should be included
 * - Text: "text" or "textRef" should be included and "fill" or "stroke" should also be included for text color
 * - Image: "src" and "width" must be included. "height" will be set with the same value as "width" if only "width" is present.
 * - Line: "stroke" must be included.
 * - Polygon: "fill" or "stroke" must be included.
 * - Box: "width" must be included, while "height" and "depth" will be set with the same value as "width" if only "width" is present. Either "fill" or "stroke" should be included
 * - Sphere: A style of type Sphere must include "radius" and "fill".
 * - VerticalLine: "stroke" must be included.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
